# 1. VALAR W1: Smart Window Opener

## a. Printing The Files

Download the design files [here.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0048/6244/3590/files/Model_W.rar?v=1611853796)

Unzip the folder.

You will find two folders named "Open Left" and "Open Right". 

For windows that **OPEN TO the left**, use the "Left" folder. For windows that open **OPEN TO the right**, use the "Right Folder".

![Window Orientation](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0048/6244/3590/files/Window_Move_Direction.jpg?v=1610585569)


Inside both folders you will see all of the parts individually, as well as all of them placed on one platter. 

Everything on the platter is placed in the correct orientation.

when printing so many parts together, there’s always a chance of print failure, so it's recommended that you print the 3 larger flat pieces separately. This also keeps the large parts from warping.

The easiest way to begin is to open up the platter and delete the parts you do not want to print. This will ensure you print everything in the correct orientation.

**Printer Setup:**

-No supports
-0.2mm layer height
-PETG filament.
